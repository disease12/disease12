Chronic diseases are long-lasting conditions that often progress slowly over time. These illnesses, such as diabetes, heart disease, and arthritis, significantly impact a person's quality of life, leading to ongoing medical treatment and lifestyle changes. Managing a list of chronic diseases involves understanding the symptoms and causes, as well as finding the best ways to cope with them.

Chronic diseases can affect anyone, and many factors contribute to their development, including genetics, lifestyle choices, and environmental factors. Early detection and proper management are key to reducing their impact.
